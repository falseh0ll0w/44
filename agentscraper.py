Explanation:
1. The code above is a Python script named `web_scraper.py`.
2. We import the necessary libraries: requests for making HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, PyPDF2 for creating PDF files, and TextBlob for sentiment analysis.
3. We define a function called `web_scraper` that takes a URL as input.
4. Inside the function, we make an HTTP request to the given URL and parse the webpage using BeautifulSoup.
5. We then convert the webpage to a PDF file using PyPDF2.
6. Next, we extract Python code blocks from the webpage and save them
